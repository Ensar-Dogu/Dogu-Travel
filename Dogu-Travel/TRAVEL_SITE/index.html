        <h3>Unesco World Heritage Sites</h3>
        <p>Offering UNESCO World Heritage Sites, sprawling national parks, picturesque seaside
          villages, a world-class food scene, and quite possibly the country’s friendliest locals, you’d
          think Newfoundland would be swarming with tourists. However, this Canadian island that
          sits off the eastern coast of the country, flanking Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, sees
          a mere fraction of the visitors of British Columbia and Alberta. </p>

      <h3>A Rugged, Remote Foodie Haven</h3>
      <p>“It’s a rugged remoteness. The glacial-swept highlands conjure up fairy tales, the mighty
        fjords breed a difficulty of exploration that boasts an incredible sense of accomplishment,”
        said Andy Nichols, expert outdoor guide of Great Canadian Trails. “To sum up the
        community here, it’s simple: It’s a place where no one locks their doors.” Offering UNESCO
        World Heritage Sites, sprawling national parks, picturesque seaside villages, a world-class
        food scene, and quite possibly the country’s friendliest locals, you’d think Newfoundland
        would be swarming with tourists. However, this Canadian island that sits off the eastern coast
        of the country, flanking Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, sees a mere fraction of the
        visitors of British Columbia and Alberta. Newfoundland’s most inspiring national park, Gros
        Morne, sees a quarter of the visitors of Alberta’s famed Banff National Park and Lake
        Louise—two parks that are anticipating more than 5 million visitors this year alone. If you’re
        craving hikes that both challenge and inspire; food that’s as local as you can possibly get
        (think fish caught off the harbor where you’re eating); and secluded campsites, skip the
        crowds of Alberta and head to Newfoundland instead. Get 1 year of American Vogue + a

        soaring mountain ranges to deep valleys and gorges, yet it is truly untouched. You can go and
        hike in peak season with a handful of people, not thousands,” said Ian Stone, guide and
        partner of Great Canadian Trails. “You can experience a national park that is not bursting at
        the seams with people but bursting with natural surroundings, moments of peace. I feel this is
        the type of place that Banff was 100 years ago.” “It’s a rugged remoteness. The glacial-swept highlands conjure up fairy tales, the mighty
